So he starts yelling “help help I’ve been electrocuted” and he hears whoever is behind him leave. He keeps yelling and eventually a guy in a neighbouring business hears him and comes to his aid. When he’s at the hospital he finds out he wasn’t electrocuted, someone had hit him on the back of the head with his own mallet.

After I got across I looked in my mirror and the fog is gone but it looked like someone was standing in the middle of the bridge.

And progressed slowly into being kept awake by something shaking the bed, or pulling off your covers. Sometimes even whispering your name. The board would disappear for days on end, then show up in places you never would have put it. I became obsessed with it. Then it was a black mass in the corner of the room. Or the silhouette of a man watching you from the doorway. After that it escalated pretty quickly. I had my hair pulled. Fingers pricked. Scratched. Choked.
